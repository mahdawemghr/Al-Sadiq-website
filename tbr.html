            I apologize for any confusion. The CSS code you provided should work correctly for applying a transition effect to anchor elements within the header when they are being hovered over. 

However, there could be other factors or conflicting CSS rules affecting the behavior. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:

1. Check that the HTML structure is correct: Make sure the element and the elements are properly nested within each other.

2. Verify that the CSS code is being applied: Make sure the CSS code is included in the correct style sheet and is properly linked to the HTML document.

3. Check for conflicting CSS rules: Make sure there are no other CSS rules targeting the same anchor elements that might override or conflict with the transition effect. CSS specificity also plays a role in determining which rules are applied.

4. Inspect the elements using browser developer tools: Use the browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to inspect the targeted anchor elements within the header and verify if the CSS rules are being applied correctly and if there are any errors or conflicting styles.

If you can provide more details or share the HTML and CSS code you are using, I'll be happy to take a closer look and help you further.
